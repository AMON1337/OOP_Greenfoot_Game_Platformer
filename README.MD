Welcome to the Cooperative Greenfoot Trash Collector, a platformer game developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project using Java and the Greenfoot framework.

## Technical Details

- **Framework:** [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/)
- **Game Type:** Two-player cooperative platformer
- **Objective:** Apply OOP principles in the development of an interactive and engaging game.

## Game Theme

Welcome to the Cooperative Greenfoot Trash Collector, a two-player platformer game designed for collaborative play. In this game, players must work together to navigate through the level, collecting falling trash bags and buckets to earn points. The thematic focus on environmental conservation adds a meaningful context to the cooperative gameplay experience.

## Game Mechanics

- **Objective:** Collect as many falling trash bags and buckets as possible to earn points.
  
- **Cooperative Play:** Both players need to collaborate to succeed. Coordinate your movements to optimize trash collection and avoid hazards.

- **Scoring:** Accumulate points based on the number of collected trash items. The more you collect, the higher your score.

- **Hazards:** Watch out for falling radiation hazards. If a player falls or touches radiation, they lose a life.
